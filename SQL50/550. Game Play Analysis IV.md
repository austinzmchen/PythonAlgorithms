Solution:

```
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT d1.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2)
    as fraction
FROM Activity d1
WHERE (player_id, DATE_SUB(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) IN (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)
```

Wrong: because `DATEDIFF(d2.event_date, d1.event_date) = 1` counts 2 consecutive login days, even neither is the initial logon day
    btw, `CROSS JOIN` does not need `ON` clause

```
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT d1.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2)
    as fraction
FROM Activity d1
CROSS JOIN Activity d2 ON d1.player_id = d2.player_id 
WHERE DATEDIFF(d2.event_date, d1.event_date) = 1
```
