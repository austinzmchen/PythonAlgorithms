Solution :

```
SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0) average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id
```


`JOIN ... AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date` 

is different from 

`WHERE u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date`

If UnitsSold table is empty, the first one still gives results since left-join,
while the second one gives empty table.
