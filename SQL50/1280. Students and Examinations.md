Wrong, because Exam table have incomplete data.
    Need to use Subjects `e.subject_name` in the last 2 lines

Also because `COUNT(s.student_id)` should be `COUNT(e.student_id)` because some student may not have taken the exams

```
SELECT s.student_id, student_name, su.subject_name, COUNT(s.student_id) as attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects su
LEFT JOIN Examinations e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    AND e.subject_name = su.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, e.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, s.student_name, e.subject_name
```
